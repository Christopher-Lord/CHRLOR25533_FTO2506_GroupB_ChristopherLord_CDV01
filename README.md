      <br>

   -  **Skills to Develop or Improve** 
      - I need to dive deeper into Advanced CSS, such as grid, flexbox and animations 
      - Soon I'll be diving into JavaScript 
      - I would like to expand my animation knowledge by learning MEL 
      - As an aside I would like to start learning the VFX software Houdini

      <br>

2. **Interests and Values**:

   - Creative freedom is a core value that I seek when considering career opportunities. I enjoy seeing my creative visions unfold and come to life. I look forward to exploring the possibilities of merging my pre-existing knowledge of animation with my evolving experience in coding. 

   <br>

   - I value a work atmosphere that promotes teamwork, constructive communication and constant learning. I resonate with a macro-management style of leadership as it allows for a healthy work dynamic. 


### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:

   - Front-End and Full-Stack Development
   - Lighting Technical Director: Solving problems that show up in the creation of lighting scenes
   - Software Development: Making apps and tools for 3D artists to make their job easier

   <br>

   -  While Full-Stack is more versatile, I definitely gravitate more towards Front-End Development, TD and Software Development as I am much more interested in the creative aspects, so focusing on going down that route is more interesting to me. 

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:

   - I think the industries/roles mentioned fit rather well with my current and future skill set, and interests. They all involve working in an artistic capacity and include some form of problem solving.  

   - I would like to explore my career options a bit further, as I have always wanted to get into game development. I want to explore what going down that route would require and take the steps necessary to move in that direction.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

   - ***Complete the CodeSpace course with at least a 75% average, which will give me a leg up to landing a job as a junior developer within the first few months of 2026.***
      -  Completing the course and finding a job in the development space will be the first step to moving up in the development world.

   - ***Dedicate time to learning two new coding languages by August 2026 in order to broaden my skill set and increase my career opportunities.***
      - Learning new coding languages, like MEL or C++, will increase the amount of opportunities I have and allow me to start working towards my future goals.

   - ***Work my way up from junior to mid-level developer by the end of 2027 in order to increase my experience in the industry.***
      - Working my way up in the development industry will hopefully give me the experience needed to work on bigger projects.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

   -  ***Get back into the animation industry by the end of 2028 so I can start merging my two skill sets.***
      - Getting back into the animation industry with my new development skills will allow me to use both sets of skills that I've learned to get me one step closer to entering the gaming industry.

   - ***Learn everything that is required to get a job in the gaming industry and use that to hopefully land a game dev job around 2030.***
      - The gaming industry is one that aligns with almost all my interests and working my way towards that will help me develop the skills necessary to accomplish my goal.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:

   - Use all resources at my disposal to make sure I am ahead of the game in order to achieve at least a 75% average in the CodeSpace course
   - Research job opportunities and companies to be prepared for when I enter the development workforce.

   - Sign up for and conduct research on websites like Udemy, in order to find the best place to learn the new coding languages.

   - Work to the best of my ability in order to work my way up the ladder at whatever company I end up at.
<br>
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals:**

   - To prepare for my long term goals I will need to make sure I understand the intricacies of both industries that I want to merge. I will need to make sure I find a way in which both fields can come together in harmony.
   - I will need experience in software development with a proven track record of tools and apps to show my skills.
   - Moving to the gaming industry will require learning some new software, such as Unreal Engine or Unity. 

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:

   -  My main obstacle in achieving any of my goals will definitely be my proclivity for procrastination. To overcome this I will need to set myself schedules and deadlines that I need to stick to in order to keep up my work ethic and my motivation. 

   - Another challenge will be finding the right entry point into the development industry in order to gain experience in the skills needed to achieve my goals. This can be overcome with careful research as well as making contacts in the industry to find the right path.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:

   -  Super Friendship Arcade is an event I attend whenever it comes around, it is a gathering of software and hardware engineers that get together to collaborate on fun and innovative indie games with interesting, home-made controllers. It provides opportunities to network with local game devs and take a peek behind the curtain of game development.

   - I have a few friends that are either learning software development or are already in the field, so getting together with them and learning together is a great chance learn new things and even help each other in areas where we might be lacking.
